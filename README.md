This is a chat app which runs on your browser.

You can login, create a room with the people you choose to chat with, add/remove people from it. You can view the rooms you are in and have created.

Begin by signing up (if this is your first time in the chat app). You can login if you have already signed up before.
Then you can create a room, join the room to chat in it, edit the room (if you're the one who created it) and view other rooms where you've been added.
